# Seating Arrangement - Market Research

AI-powered seating arrangement optimization for weddings and corporate events

## Key Takeaways

- **Space planning anxiety is widespread**: Multiple posts show confusion about venue capacity (60-70 people in unknown space, 100 guests in 2500 sq ft, small home Christmas parties), indicating a clear need for visualization tools that help people understand if their space will actually accommodate their guest count.

- **Seating decisions span multiple planning stages**: Posts show seating concerns appearing 7+ months before events, last-minute flow planning for 48-guest restaurant venues, and day-of questions. This suggests the tool should support iterative planning throughout the entire event lifecycle, not just one-time use.

- **Social dynamics remain critical but underserved**: Posts about child-free enforcement, family tensions, and single guest accommodation show that seating isn't just a spatial problem—it's a relationship optimization challenge. AI-powered suggestions that consider social factors could be a major differentiator.

- **Small detail regret is common**: Brides regret skipping "small" details like seating cards and signage, but unique DIY approaches (toy cars as favors/seating chart) show creativity. A tool that balances professional optimization with personalization would address both needs.

- **Venue communication failures create stress**: Multiple vendor horror stories (Simply Perfect Events, Monte Event Space) and slow event manager responses suggest couples lack confidence in their planning. A self-service tool that provides instant answers could reduce dependence on unresponsive vendors.
