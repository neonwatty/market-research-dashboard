## Key Takeaways

- **Direct seating balance concerns reveal optimization opportunities**: A couple planning one long table explicitly worried about having 25 guests on one side versus 23 on the other, demonstrating that AI-powered tools could instantly solve these micro-optimization anxieties that manual planning makes stressful.

- **Seating chart decisions create early-stage planning uncertainty**: Brides 7+ months out explicitly need to "decide the type of seating chart" but lack guidance on when and how to tackle this milestone, showing demand for educational content and phased planning tools.

- **DIY execution struggles persist even close to wedding date**: A couple 15 days before their wedding was still scrambling to find printing services for their envelope-based seating chart display, highlighting the gap between creative vision and practical execution that streamlined tools could bridge.

- **Venue failures validate need for self-service backup systems**: The TWA Hotel coordination disaster and Simply Perfect Events warning demonstrate that even professional venues and coordinators can fail catastrophically at logistics, reinforcing that couples need their own reliable planning and arrangement tools.

- **Graduated couples emphasize preparation leads to perfect days**: Multiple fresh wedding recaps from late 2025 (Madonna Inn, October weddings, December graduates) specifically validate that proper attention to logistics and details—including seating—directly contributed to wonderful wedding day experiences.
