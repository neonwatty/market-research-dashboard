## Key Takeaways

- **Guest coordination frustrations drive demand for automation**: A bride already dreading repetitive "what time is the ceremony?" texts highlights the broader challenge of guest information management that extends to seating arrangements - couples want automated solutions that reduce their coordination burden.

- **Micro-optimization anxieties persist as pain points**: A couple explicitly worried about having 25 guests on one side of a long table versus 23 on the other demonstrates that seating balance concerns extend to granular details that AI-powered tools could instantly solve.

- **Budget-conscious couples still prioritize proper planning**: A successfully executed 100-person wedding under $15K (September 2025) proves that even cost-sensitive couples invest in logistics and details - seating tools must serve both premium and budget market segments.

- **Early planning timeline confusion creates educational opportunity**: Brides 7+ months out explicitly need to "decide the type of seating chart" but lack guidance on when and how to tackle this milestone, showing demand for tools with built-in educational content and phased planning guidance.

- **Physical display execution creates last-minute stress**: A couple 15 days before their wedding scrambling to find printing services for their envelope-based seating chart board highlights the gap between creative digital planning and practical physical execution.
