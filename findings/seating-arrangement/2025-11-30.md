# Seating Arrangement - Market Research

AI-powered seating arrangement optimization for weddings and corporate events

## Key Takeaways

- **Seating charts remain a top-3 wedding planning stressor**: Multiple posts show couples struggling with last-minute seating disasters, family dynamics management, and decision paralysis about when to finalize arrangements (7+ months out discussions).

- **DIY solutions are popular but failure-prone**: Brides are creating custom seating charts (mirrors, acrylic signs, envelope boards, toy cars) but frequently encounter execution problems - glue showing, printing issues, design concerns - often just days before the wedding.

- **Emotional and relationship complexity drives the need**: Beyond logistics, seating charts involve managing family tensions, accommodating single guests socially, and avoiding conflict - making it more than just a space planning problem.

- **Small details create post-wedding regrets**: Multiple couples report regretting skipping or under-investing in seating cards and signage, suggesting there's value in getting these "small" details right.

- **Market is actively seeking solutions**: Couples are researching vendors (Zola), hiring designers for invitation suites + day-of signage, and asking for creative seating chart ideas, indicating openness to tools that simplify the process.
