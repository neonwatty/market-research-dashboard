## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** weddingplanning
- **Keywords:** guest list, seating plan, reception layout, event planning

## Key Takeaways

- **Guest list management directly impacts seating complexity**: Multiple posts reveal how guest list changes (uninvited guests showing up, RSVP uncertainties, surprise proposal parties with 75 attendees) create cascading seating challenges that require flexible planning tools.

- **Wedding planners are expensive and sometimes problematic**: One couple was pushed over €115k without consent, while another was required to hire a planner but questioned the value - suggesting a market gap for affordable self-service tools that provide planner-level organization.

- **Financial volatility creates last-minute replanning needs**: Grandparents pulling 1/3 of wedding funds 4 months out, plus budget-conscious couples trying to serve 50-200 guests affordably, shows need for tools that help optimize space/seating to control costs.

- **Post-wedding validation confirms small details matter**: Recent wedding graduates consistently report that details they almost skipped (like seating cards) ended up being important, reinforcing that seating arrangement tools provide real value.

- **Timeline stress peaks around RSVP management**: February 2026 brides feeling overwhelmed in December, plus posts about "how many guests actually came" show the anxiety around finalizing seating when RSVPs are uncertain or guests are unreliable.
