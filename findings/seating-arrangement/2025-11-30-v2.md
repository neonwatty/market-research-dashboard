# Seating Arrangement - Market Research

AI-powered seating arrangement optimization for weddings and corporate events

## Key Takeaways

- **Seating logistics are a critical pain point**: From kids' table arrangements to managing family tensions, couples struggle with strategic seating decisions. The highly upvoted post on kids' table arrangement (733 upvotes) shows that tactical seating solutions can make or break event success.

- **Floor plan visualization tools are actively sought**: Multiple posts specifically asking for floor plan visualization platforms and layout planning tools indicate a clear market need for better spatial planning software.

- **DIY challenges persist**: Posts about mirrors, acrylic signs, and last-minute seating chart disasters reveal that couples attempt DIY solutions but face execution problems - glue showing, design issues, and printing challenges.

- **Strategic seating for social dynamics**: Beyond physical layout, couples need help managing complex social dynamics through seating - single guests, family tensions, kids placement. This is a relationship optimization problem, not just a space problem.

- **Timing uncertainty**: Multiple discussions around when to finalize seating charts (7+ months out) suggest couples lack clear guidance on the optimal timeline for this critical task.

- **Corporate events underrepresented**: Wedding planning dominates the discussion, with minimal activity in corporate event planning subreddits - potential untapped market or different customer acquisition channels needed.
