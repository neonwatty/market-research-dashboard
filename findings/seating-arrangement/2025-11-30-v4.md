AI-powered seating arrangement optimization for weddings and corporate events

## Key Takeaways

- **Kids table optimization is a proven value driver**: A highly upvoted post (729 upvotes) showcases how strategic kids table arrangement prevented disruptions throughout an entire wedding, demonstrating concrete ROI for AI-powered seating optimization beyond just spatial layout.

- **Venue capacity anxiety is pervasive**: Multiple posts show couples questioning whether their space will accommodate guests (100 people in 2500 sq ft, 50-person micro-weddings, small home parties), indicating strong demand for visualization tools that provide confidence in space planning decisions.

- **Seating extends beyond weddings to general event planning**: Party planning subreddit shows active discussions about NYE/birthday parties, Christmas gatherings, and intimate dinners, suggesting the tool's market extends beyond weddings to general social event hosting.

- **Social dynamics complexity demands intelligent solutions**: Posts about single guest accommodation, family tensions, and child-free enforcement reveal that seating isn't just geometry - it's relationship management. AI that considers social factors could be a major differentiator from basic floor plan tools.

- **Budget-conscious couples seek self-service solutions**: Multiple $13k-$35k budget discussions and venue cost concerns suggest couples want tools that reduce reliance on expensive planners and give them direct control over critical decisions like seating arrangements.
