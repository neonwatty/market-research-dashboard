## Key Takeaways
- Side features generating 3x more revenue than main products highlight the importance of clear visual demos to help users discover and understand secondary features - automated demo generation could showcase hidden features
- Signup optimization experiments (340% signup increase, 60% conversion decrease when removing credit card requirement) emphasize the need for better onboarding demos to qualify leads without friction
- Engineers struggling with communication ("don't know how to talk to people") represent a key demographic for automated demo tools - technical founders who need to convey product value without live presentations
- Open source project launches (Relaticle CRM, DocNode library) continue requiring professional demos to compete against proprietary solutions and attract contributors
- Founders manually recording personal walkthrough videos for premium customers ($2400 annual plans) remains a persistent pain point that scripted automation could solve at scale
