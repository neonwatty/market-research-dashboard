# Demo-Recorder - Market Research
A CLI tool to automate demo video and screenshot creation for web applications using Playwright

## Key Takeaways
- Documentation and tutorial creation is a major pain point for developers, with multiple posts seeking tools for step-by-step guides with screenshots and annotations
- SaaS founders struggle with creating product demos efficiently - recording custom demos for each prospect is time-consuming and inconsistent
- There's strong demand for automated demo creation that can be version-controlled and regenerated as products evolve
- Product launch videos and screenshots are critical for marketing but creating them manually is resource-intensive (one founder spent 30 hours on a cinematic demo)
- The gap between building features and documenting them is causing internal communication issues, with teams wasting 300+ hours/year searching for information
