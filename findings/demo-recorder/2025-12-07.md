- SaaS founders are investing significant budgets in launch videos (€250 documented), specifically seeking character-based animated explainers for marketing funnels - highlighting opportunity for demo-recorder to generate complementary technical demo content at lower cost
- Self-service demos continue to outperform live demo calls, with 12% conversion increase documented by removing "Book a Demo" button - validates market shift toward automated, always-available product tours that demo-recorder enables
- Founders manually recording personal walkthrough videos for premium customers ($2400 annual plans) represents ongoing pain point that scripted demo automation could solve at scale
- Open source project launches (Common Ground, Relaticle, DocNode) require extensive visual documentation and demos to communicate technical architecture and attract contributors - demo-recorder's Playwright automation fits this workflow
- Technical deep dives and documentation (280-page WordPress analysis with 300+ hours invested) demonstrate massive time investment in visual documentation - automation tools could reduce this burden significantly
