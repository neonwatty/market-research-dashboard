# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, EntrepreneurRideAlong, SaaS, Entrepreneur, IMadeThis
- **Keywords:** market research, customer discovery, validate idea, finding users, target audience, product-market fit, market validation, user research, customer interviews, talk to users, user feedback, early customers

## Key Takeaways
- **Post-launch user acquisition is the universal struggle**: Founders repeatedly ask "now what?" after shipping, with questions like "how to get first 100 users" and "can't sell what I built" dominating discussions
- **Validation before team scaling is critical**: Multiple founders report hiring too early as a fatal mistake - "scaling team before validating product" and near-failure stories from premature hiring
- **Speed-to-market beats perfection**: Success stories emphasize rapid iteration (12 apps in 12 months, 8 SaaS in 2 years, 10-14 day build cycles) over months of pre-launch polish
- **Fear of idea theft blocks critical customer conversations**: Founders remain paralyzed by IP concerns, preventing them from conducting essential validation interviews with potential users
- **Survival mode without PMF is brutal**: Raw discussions about spending a year "talking to folks to validate" with no revenue, showing the emotional toll of extended customer discovery phases
