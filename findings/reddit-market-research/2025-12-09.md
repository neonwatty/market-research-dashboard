# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, EntrepreneurRideAlong, SaaS, Entrepreneur, roastmystartup, IMadeThis
- **Keywords:** market research, customer discovery, validate idea, finding users, target audience, product-market fit, market validation, user research, customer interviews, talk to users, user feedback, early customers, finding customers, landing page, MVP feedback, beta testers, first users, user acquisition

## Key Takeaways
- **Post-launch panic continues to dominate**: Founders repeatedly ship products then immediately ask "now what?" - the pattern of launching first, then figuring out user acquisition shows validation should happen before building
- **Technical founders struggle with the "talking to people" barrier**: Engineers excel at building but avoid customer discovery - preferring to stay in the comfort zone of coding rather than conducting market validation conversations
- **Fear of idea theft remains a persistent blocker**: Multiple posts show founders paralyzed by IP concerns, preventing essential pre-build customer feedback that would save them from building unwanted products
- **Speed-to-market consistently beats perfection**: Success stories emphasize 10-14 day build cycles over months of pre-launch polish - rapid iteration enables faster market validation and learning
- **Co-founder conflicts expose lack of early validation**: Drama around equity, decision-making, and direction often stems from misaligned expectations that proper market validation and customer discovery could have prevented
