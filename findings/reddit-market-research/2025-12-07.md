# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, EntrepreneurRideAlong, SaaS, Entrepreneur
- **Keywords:** market research, customer discovery, validate idea, finding users, target audience, product-market fit, market validation, user research, customer interviews

## Key Takeaways
- **The post-launch user acquisition struggle intensifies**: Founders continue to launch and immediately ask "now what?" - post-launch panic about getting first 100 users after building shows validation should happen before launch
- **The validation-to-revenue timeline is brutal without PMF**: Raw founder accounts of spending 10 months doing 50+ demos with $0 revenue, or entire year in customer discovery mode without traction - highlights emotional and financial toll of validation phase
- **Speed-to-market continues to outperform perfectionism**: Multiple success stories emphasize shipping 8 SaaS in 2 years with 10-14 day build cycles, proving rapid iteration beats prolonged pre-launch development
- **Customer research skills gap persists even with traction**: Founder with 4,000 free users but only 50 paid doesn't know how to conduct customer interviews - shows validation methodology knowledge is lacking beyond initial launch
- **Fear of idea theft still blocks essential validation conversations**: Founders remain paralyzed by IP concerns preventing them from gathering critical customer feedback before building
