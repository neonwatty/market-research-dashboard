# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, EntrepreneurRideAlong, SaaS, Entrepreneur, IMadeThis, roastmystartup
- **Keywords:** market research, customer discovery, validate idea, finding users, target audience, product-market fit, market validation, user research, customer interviews, talk to users, user feedback, early customers, finding customers, landing page, MVP feedback

## Key Takeaways
- **The "build first, validate later" pattern remains the dominant failure mode**: Founders continue launching products then immediately asking "now what?" and "how do I get my first 100 users?" - showing validation should precede building, not follow it
- **Fear of idea theft actively blocks essential validation conversations**: Multiple founders express paralysis around gathering customer feedback before building, preventing the very validation that would save them from building unwanted products
- **The pre-revenue validation phase is emotionally and financially brutal**: Raw accounts of spending a full year in customer discovery mode without PMF or revenue reveal the painful reality most founder advice glosses over
- **Early-stage founders face a critical validation skills gap**: Even founders with traction (4k users, 50 paid) don't know how to conduct customer interviews to improve conversion - showing methodology knowledge is lacking beyond initial launch
- **Speed-to-market consistently outperforms perfectionism**: Multiple success stories (8 SaaS in 2 years, 10-14 day build cycles) prove rapid iteration and market testing beats months of pre-launch development
