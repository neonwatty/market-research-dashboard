# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Key Takeaways
- **Validation is the biggest pain point**: Founders consistently struggle with validating ideas before building, wasting weeks/months on features nobody wants
- **Customer discovery is hard**: Finding and reaching the right target audience for validation interviews is a major challenge, with low response rates
- **"Build first, validate later" is common**: Many founders admit to building products without proper validation, leading to zero traction and wasted effort
- **Quick validation is desired**: There's strong demand for faster validation methods (48-hour frameworks vs 4-week processes)
- **Tools for validation are sought**: Multiple posts mention building or seeking tools specifically for idea validation, waitlist creation, and customer research
