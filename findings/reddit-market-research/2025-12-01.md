# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, EntrepreneurRideAlong, SaaS, Entrepreneur
- **Keywords:** market research, customer discovery, validate idea, finding users, target audience, customer interviews, product validation
- **Time Range:** Last week
- **Results:** 50 posts

## Key Takeaways
- **Validation before building is the #1 pain point**: Founders repeatedly waste months building products nobody wants, with multiple posts about failed launches with 0 signups/users
- **Customer discovery is intimidating and hard**: Founders struggle to find people willing to do interviews, get low response rates, and don't know where to find their target audience
- **"Build first, validate later" remains epidemic**: Despite knowing better, founders continue shipping MVPs without talking to users first, leading to predictable failures
- **Tools specifically for validation/discovery are in demand**: Multiple posts about building waitlist tools, validation frameworks, and customer research platforms
- **Real customer conversations transform businesses**: The few founders who actually do customer discovery report dramatic improvements and breakthroughs
