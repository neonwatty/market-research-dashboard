# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, SaaS
- **Keywords:** market research, validate
- **Time Range:** Last week
- **Results:** 50 posts

## Key Takeaways
- **Validation remains the #1 failure point for founders**: Multiple posts show founders building for months without talking to users first, resulting in failed launches (e.g., 14 months building 11 AI apps = $2,847 total; Product Hunt #4 = 2,400 visitors but 0 customers)
- **Founders struggle with "how" to validate, not "why"**: Posts asking "How to validate a business idea", "B2B Market Validation Help", and validation questions dominate - founders know they need validation but don't know the practical steps
- **Reddit itself is emerging as a validation platform**: Multiple posts mention using Reddit for validation conversations, with one founder stating their startup "received a surprising amount of positive validation from Reddit, Discord communities"
- **Market research tools are actively being built and discussed**: Posts about Reddit marketing tools, market research automation, and customer discovery platforms indicate strong interest in this category
- **"Too much product before validation" is epidemic**: Founders repeatedly ship polished UX, full MVPs, or multiple features before confirming anyone wants the core value proposition
