# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, EntrepreneurRideAlong, SaaS, Entrepreneur
- **Keywords:** market research, customer discovery, validate idea, finding users, target audience
- **Time Range:** Last week
- **Results:** 20 posts

## Key Takeaways
- **Validation paralysis is real**: Founders are questioning whether validation is even necessary, stuck between "just ship it" advice and cautionary tales of building without validation
- **First customer acquisition is a massive bottleneck**: Multiple posts asking how to get first 10-20 customers for validation, with standard advice (cold outreach, social media) requiring 4-5 hours daily
- **Fear of idea theft blocks validation conversations**: Founders afraid to ask for feedback, creating a psychological barrier to customer discovery before technical barriers even arise
- **Post-mortems continue to validate validation**: 2-year health-tech startup failure, repeated product failures, and ad spend waste all trace back to insufficient early customer discovery
- **Reddit itself is becoming a validation tool**: Multiple posts about Reddit marketing tools, using Reddit for customer discovery, and founders explicitly seeking other founders for validation conversations
