# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, EntrepreneurRideAlong, SaaS, Entrepreneur
- **Keywords:** market research, customer discovery, validate idea, finding users, target audience, product-market fit, market validation, user research, customer interviews
- **Time Range:** Last week
- **Results:** 20 posts

## Key Takeaways
- **"Building without validation" continues to be the dominant failure pattern**: Fresh examples include 24 days building with mass indifference at launch, 35 days building "nobody wanted", and founders explicitly stating "Built my MVP without validation, now struggling to find users"
- **Founders are building validation tools to solve their own validation failures**: Multiple posts from founders who failed to validate their first SaaS and are now building validation tools (ShipOrSkip AI validator, validation tool after $0 revenue)
- **The validation meta-discussion is accelerating**: Founders asking "is there a place where people share real work problems and put money down before MVP exists?" - showing sophistication about pre-launch validation
- **Market validation methodology remains unclear**: Posts asking for help "validating SaaS idea" and "trying to validate" show founders understand they need validation but lack practical execution frameworks
- **Success stories emphasize validation lessons**: $30k/year app scaling post and 12 apps/$4k MRR challenge both contain validation and product-market fit insights that resonate with struggling founders
