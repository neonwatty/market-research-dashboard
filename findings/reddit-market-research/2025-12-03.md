# Reddit Market Research Tool - Market Research
A Python CLI tool that searches Reddit to help developers identify potential users and market opportunities by finding relevant discussions and pain points across subreddits.

## Search Parameters
- **Subreddits:** SideProject, indiehackers, startups, EntrepreneurRideAlong, SaaS, Entrepreneur
- **Keywords:** market research, customer discovery, validate, finding users, target audience, customer interviews
- **Time Range:** Last week
- **Results:** 50 posts

## Key Takeaways
- **Customer discovery done right transforms outcomes**: Multiple founders report breakthrough insights from conducting 30+ customer interviews, with 90% of learnings being non-feature related (positioning, pricing, actual pain points vs assumed ones)
- **"Building without validation" remains the #1 failure pattern**: Fresh examples include 5 months building without user feedback, 20 days shipping with 0 revenue, and founders explicitly asking "how to recover after spending too long building without validation"
- **Validation methodology is the actual pain point**: Posts directly asking "how to validate" and "best ways to validate an app idea" show founders understand they need validation but lack practical frameworks for executing it
- **Reddit as a validation channel is growing**: Multiple posts about Reddit marketing tools, using Reddit for customer discovery, and successful validation conversations happening on Reddit itself
- **The gap between knowing and doing validation is massive**: Despite success stories showing validation works, founders continue to skip it due to intimidation factor, not knowing where to start, or false confidence in their assumptions
