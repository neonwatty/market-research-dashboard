- **Note:** Reddit API continues to experience 404 errors with multi-keyword searches; successfully retrieved results using single-keyword searches across targeted communities

## Key Takeaways
- Podcasters and video editors are overwhelmed by time-intensive editing workflows - one editor spent 12 hours on a 2-minute video, while podcasters consistently express frustration with post-production workload
- YouTube creators remain confused by inconsistent demonetization policies, with no clear guidance on which words trigger penalties (blood, hell, genocide, illegal) - creating demand for automated censorship tools that eliminate guesswork
- Teachers actively seek privacy-first tools after incidents where educators were fired for using external AI services - browser-based solutions that don't upload content are highly appealing for educational use cases
- Educational content discovery remains a challenge for teachers - they need tools to make existing videos classroom-safe rather than being restricted to pre-approved content libraries
- Free, accessible editing software is in high demand among educators and new podcasters, particularly those creating content for school projects or classroom use
