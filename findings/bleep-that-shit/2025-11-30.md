# Bleep That Sh*t! - Market Research
In-browser audio and video censorship tool that uses AI to automatically identify and bleep profanity or custom words

## Key Takeaways
- Content creators actively struggle with YouTube's strict profanity policies and seek solutions for bleeping swear words to maintain monetization
- There's confusion among creators about whether self-censoring (saying "corn" instead of "porn", "unalive" instead of "suicide") is necessary, indicating demand for automated censorship tools
- Creators are editing the same video twice (one with bleeps, one without) to test what works best for the algorithm - showing manual process pain points
- Video editors are actively searching for censorship effects (like pixelation/mosaic filters), demonstrating market for automated content moderation tools
- YouTube's inconsistent enforcement creates anxiety among creators, making preventative censorship tools valuable for avoiding demonetization
